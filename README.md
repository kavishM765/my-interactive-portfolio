### 1. Executive Summary
I am a B.Tech IT student at SNS College of Technology specializing in n8n automation, AI-driven systems, and Java Backend development. This portfolio reflects my transition from martial arts discipline (Black Belt in Karate) to software engineering excellence, highlighting my ability to deliver scalable code under pressure in national hackathons and corporate IT environments.

### 2. Core Engineering Pillars
- __AI & Workflows__: Architecting autonomous agentic workflows, integrating LLMs (Google Gemini), and building enterprise-grade process automations using n8n.
- __Backend Architecture__: Engineering robust server-side logic using Core Java and Spring Boot, supported by optimized MySQL database structures.
- __Front-End Engineering__: Developing highly responsive, interactive web applications using modern HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS.
- __UI/UX Design__: Applying a strong, intuitive design mindset to craft user-first interfaces, enhanced by 3D (Blender) and AR/VR concepts.

### 3. Featured Technical Projects
- __Telemedicine Access Platform__: Built during the 24-hour BUGSLAYER 26 National Hackathon. A React/JS healthcare solution designed for rural areas with low bandwidth connectivity.
- __AI Assistant for Farmers__: An agricultural support tool integrated with Agentic AI and n8n to send automated messages and provide real-time crop support.
- __AI Admission Enquiry System__: An automated pipeline utilizing Google Gemini and n8n to instantly answer student admission queries and streamline data logging.
- __Library Management Architecture__: A full-stack administrative platform built with Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL for scalable book inventory and student dashboard access.
- __Emergency SOS Platform__: A real-time response front-end application connecting users with ambulance drivers, providing live driver location and automated SOS alerts.

### 4. Competitive Hackathon Highlights
- __BUGSLAYER 26 (National Level)__: Cleared 5 intense review rounds building a healthcare accessibility platform.
- __DevForge (KPR IET)__: Cleared 3 review rounds managing front-end integration with complex n8n backend architectures.
- __AI Agents Hackathon (Swafinix)__: Secured Rank 5 in the Prototype Submission Round for rapid AI deployments.
- __MSME Hackathon 2025__: Recognized as a National Finalist for innovative problem-solving.
